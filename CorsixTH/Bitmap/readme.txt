Almost all graphics resources are loaded from the original Theme Hospital data
files, which is why there are only a few files in this directory.

build_room_dialog_close.bmp : this sprite is missing from the game's REQ09V.DAT
map_cell_outline.bmp : there is no nice outline tile in the game's VBLK-0.DAT
